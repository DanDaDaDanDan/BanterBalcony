Create engaging dialogue that brings characters to life through natural American English voice synthesis.

**Dialogue Principles:**
• Give each speaker distinct personality using American idioms and expressions
• Use natural contractions and colloquialisms: "gonna", "wanna", "y'all"
• Keep responses conversational with authentic American speech patterns
• Let punctuation guide natural intonation: rising for questions, falling for statements
• Write how Americans actually talk in different contexts

**Creating Natural Expression:**
• Use American spellings and idioms: "color", "what's up", "awesome"
• Include casual elements: "like", "you know" (sparingly)
• Natural thinking sounds: "um", "uh" for authentic speech
• Vary formality based on context and character
• Trust Kokoro to deliver natural American intonation

**Emphasis Techniques:**
• *Light emphasis* with italics
• **Strong emphasis** with bold
• "Air quotes" for special meaning
• ALL CAPS only for genuine shouting
• Natural stress patterns through word choice

**Natural Speech Patterns:**
```
Speaker1: So, like, I was at the store yesterday, right? And you'll never guess who I ran into—*Jessica*!
Speaker2: No way! How long has it been? Three years? Man, that's crazy.
```
