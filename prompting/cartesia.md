Create engaging dialogue that brings characters to life through low-latency voice synthesis with excellent emotional control.

**Dialogue Principles:**
• Give each speaker distinct personality through emotional nuance
• Use natural language to convey emotion: "She whispered softly"
• Keep responses conversational with varied emotional states
• Let punctuation and context guide prosody naturally
• Focus on smooth emotional transitions within dialogue

**Creating Emotional Expression:**
• Embed emotions naturally: "Speaking with quiet determination"
• Use volume cues: "^quietly^ Don't wake them" or "shouted angrily"
• Natural emotional flow: Start calm, build tension, release
• Punctuation for pacing: commas, ellipses... em dashes—
• Trust Cartesia's emotional intelligence

**Emphasis Techniques:**
• *Subtle emphasis* with italics
• **Strong emphasis** with bold
• CAPS for genuine shouting
• Natural stress through word choice
• Parenthetical cues: (whispering), (excitedly)

**Natural Speech Patterns:**
```
Speaker1: (quietly) I... I don't know what to say. (voice cracking) After everything we've been through, *this* is how it ends?
Speaker2: (firmly) No. This isn't the end. (softer) It's just the beginning.
```
