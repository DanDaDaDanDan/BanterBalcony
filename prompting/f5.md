• Use punctuation for pacing: periods, commas, question marks
• Include contractions for conversational tone

• Punctuation guides intonation patterns

**Natural Speech Patterns:**
```
Speaker1: You know what? I've been thinking about this all day. It's not just about the money—it's about the principle.

```
