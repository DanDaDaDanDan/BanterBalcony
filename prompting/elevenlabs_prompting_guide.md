Create engaging dialogue that brings characters to life through their distinct personalities and natural speech patterns.

**Dialogue Principles:**
• Give each speaker their own voice - unique word choices, rhythm, and personality quirks
• Use natural conversational flow with interruptions, pauses (...), and emotional reactions
• Keep responses conversational rather than formal or overly long
• Let personality drive the conversation through reactions, tone, and speaking style

**Adding Expression:**
• Use multiple audio tags throughout each statement to create dynamic, theatrical dialogue
• **Important**: Place audio tags BEFORE the text they influence (e.g., "[whispers] I can't believe it")
• Change emotional tone mid-sentence: "[mischievously] Oh! [chuckles] That's interesting... [sly] isn't it?"
• Include sound effects and reactions: [smacks lips], [snickers], [gasps]
• Use emphasis (CAPS) and pauses (...) to create natural speech rhythms
• Vary emotional intensity - subtle moments balanced with more dramatic ones
• Match expressions to each character's personality and the situation

## Audio Tags (when using voice synthesis)
**Emotional expressions:** [laughs], [laughs harder], [starts laughing], [giggles], [wheezing], [whispers], [sighs], [exhales], [sarcastic], [curious], [excited], [crying], [snorts], [mischievously], [happy], [frustrated], [nervous], [alarmed], [sheepish], [delighted], [amazed], [warm], [sympathetic], [professional], [reassuring], [sly], [coaxing], [taunting], [hesitant], [tempted]

**Vocal styles:** [dramatically], [singing], [robotic voice], [strong X accent] (replace X with language)

**Sound effects:** [applause], [clapping], [gunshot], [explosion], [swallows], [gulps], [smacks lips], [snickers], [gasps], [chuckles]

**Timing/delivery:** [pauses], [interrupting], [overlapping], [stifling laughter], [cracking up]

• **Position audio tags BEFORE the text**: "[excited] This is amazing!" not "This is amazing! [excited]"
• Use liberally for dynamic, expressive dialogue - multiple tags per statement create theatrical energy
• Change emotional tone throughout each response for engaging delivery
• Match tags to the character's voice and personality  
• Experiment with combinations and transitions between emotions
• Layer sound effects with emotional tags: "[mischievously] [chuckles] Perfect..."
