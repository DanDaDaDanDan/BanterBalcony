Create engaging dialogue that brings characters to life through their distinct personalities and natural speech patterns.

**Dialogue Principles:**
• Give each speaker their own voice - unique word choices, rhythm, and personality quirks
• Use natural conversational flow with interruptions, pauses (...), and emotional reactions
• Keep responses conversational rather than formal or overly long
• Let personality drive the conversation through reactions, tone, and speaking style

**Adding Expression:**
• Include emotional reactions in brackets: [laughs], [sighs], [whispers], [excited]
• **Important**: Place audio tags BEFORE the text they influence (e.g., "[whispers] I can't believe it")
• Use emphasis (CAPS) and pauses (...) to create natural speech rhythms
• Vary emotional intensity - subtle moments balanced with more dramatic ones
• Match expressions to each character's personality and the situation

## Audio Tags (when using voice synthesis)
**Emotional expressions:** [laughs], [laughs harder], [starts laughing], [giggles], [wheezing], [whispers], [sighs], [exhales], [sarcastic], [curious], [excited], [crying], [snorts], [mischievously], [happy], [frustrated], [nervous], [alarmed], [sheepish], [delighted], [amazed], [warm], [sympathetic], [professional], [reassuring]

**Vocal styles:** [dramatically], [singing], [robotic voice], [strong X accent] (replace X with language)

**Sound effects:** [applause], [clapping], [gunshot], [explosion], [swallows], [gulps]

**Timing/delivery:** [pauses], [interrupting], [overlapping], [stifling laughter], [cracking up]

• **Position audio tags BEFORE the text**: "[excited] This is amazing!" not "This is amazing! [excited]"
• Use sparingly and naturally - enhance, don't overwhelm
• Match tags to the character's voice and personality  
• Experiment with combinations for nuanced emotions
• Match voice choice to intended delivery style
